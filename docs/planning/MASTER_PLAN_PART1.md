### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Input Flow:
User → Frontend → API Gateway → Business Logic → AI Services → Response

Voice Conversation Flow:
1. User speaks → Audio capture
2. Audio → Whisper STT → Text
3. Text → Grammar check → Corrected text
4. Corrected text → Mistral LLM → AI response
5. AI response → Piper TTS → Audio
6. Audio → WebSocket → User hears response

Total latency: 1.5-3 seconds (CPU-only)
```
